    <h4>Surveillance Capitalism</h4>
<p>
    Surveillance is supposedly engineered to be cloaked. However the ethics behind it all should be questioned. Targeted ads might intrigue consumers but that is misconception. Companies implement this conception. Utilizing Google tracks so much of our personal data.  Companies do collect data and some of it is used to improve data. However companies also collect data and analyze people in models and target them for their own benefits. Surveillance capitalism is only restricted to being online. Behavioral data can predict emotions, personality, sexuality, and plus many other things.
</p>
    <p>
    On social media the posting of photos can be analyzed and predicted to business customers. In order to build revenue companies must know how humans are behaving to attract consumers. There was an experiment don’t by Facebook which they mentioned that they can manipulate people by using subliminal cues.  This can be done without users recognizing.  Now Let’s talk about the Pokémon Go game which was pioneered by Google. When it was launched it was known to be started by another company that was not Google. In reality, this was a foot fall strategy which lured consumers to businesses. A lot of businesses were making money by automating behavior while having a good time.

    <p>
    Capitalism has gone beyond knowing what people are doing online. Products that even hide microphones and record people's voices. To point out, this  was done by Google.  Companies are going behind ethics and robbing the people of their information. There have been times companies would stop and get caught. However, it still continues and just extracts data and keeps selling it. There is a range of different data. This new marketing of capitalism has evolved and seems to keep building. All age groups are studied but younger generations are even studied more.
