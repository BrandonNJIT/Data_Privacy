    <h4>Edward Snowden's Story:</h4>
    <p>
    Glenn Greenwald, a journalist for Guardian received an email one day from someone he didn’t know, it was written vaguely and just said, “I have some stuff you might be interested in”. Glen decided to ignore the email assuming it was spam. In a few days, he gets another email saying “Have you done it?”. The same person then sent an email to american filmmaker Laura Poitras, she had been getting emails from a mysterious person for around a month, the person was using her encryption keys and anonymous channels. Laura had a big meeting with another film maker Bart Gellman and to be on the safe side had canceled a meeting they had scheduled. They then had their 2 middle men use secret names to refer to each other to hide things more. The mysterious person then sent both of them an email invitation “your destination is Hong Kong”. Laura wanted to go, while the other 3 didn’t want to. She wanted to find out who was doing this to them over email. She then reached out to Glenn Greenwald to see if he would want to join her on the trip to Hong Kong and he agreed. They knew it was risky but they both really wanted to get to the bottom of this.

    On the plane ride Laura shared with Glenn a flash drive with thousands and thousands of top secret documents. In seeing all of this information Glenn was so excited to be able to be there to publish a story about this event when it was all said and done.

    Later they had found out the person contacting them was Edward Snowden. A worker for the NSA (National Security Agency), Edward had used his insider information to get to top secret NSA information and was basically showing that he could get access to it simply. This was a good thing for america to find out how easy it is for things to go wrong unexpectedly but didn’t end up being good for Edward. These acts got Edward charged with violations of the Espionage Act. Many people deem Edwards actions as a good thing as the internets safety wasn’t at a very high standard for protection at this point in time.
