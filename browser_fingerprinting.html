    <h4>Browser Fingerprinting:</h4>
<p>
    A browser fingerprint is a unique ID that is generated that is used to show exactly your browser and the things you do on the browser. With browser fingerprinting the browser can have code run in the background that can get various info Via javascript, make and model of your device you are browsing on, screen resolution, browser plug-ins, timezone you are in, if you have microsoft office installed, do you often use the browser. To get even farther it can find, it can even check how your device renders fonts, it can also test what 2D and 3D arts your device can draw via the processor, as well as making a canvas and testing more things on it along the lines of the 2D and 3D objects. Browser fingerprinting can be used to capture all of this information without you even knowing itâ€™s happening. This can make browser fingerprinting very dangerous potentially, because who knows where the technology can go in the future as far as stealing all of your data or certain data that you don't want them to without even knowing if they are taking anything from you.
</p>
    <h4>Steps To Protect Yourself:</h4>
<p>
    Use Mozilla Firefox they have implemented browser fingerprinting protection. Or you can use a tour browser. If you are trying to be super safe you can turn off javascript in browsers, however this will end up breaking many many web pages due to everything having javascript on it. Another thing to protect yourself would be to make sure you use the popular browsers example, use chrome or microsoft edge, don't use smaller known browsers like Opera. This will make your data be in an area of so much more data that the likelihood they could target you and connect everything is lower.
